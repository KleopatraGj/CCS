# Carotid Calcium Scanner (CCS)

A browser-based semi-automatic tool that identifies morphologic features of carotid atherosclerotic calcifications. The current goal of this project is based around allowing users to identify areas of calcific plaque build-up and calculating morphologic features of the build up based on the user annotation. Later goals include automatic identification of calcific plaque structures and potentially a machine learning algorithm to improve detection of calcific plaque.

# Clinical Relevance

Carotid artherosclerotic plaque in the neck is a common cause of ischemic stroke in the brain. Atherosclerosis is the deposition of inflamed fat in the vessel walls that lead to hardening of the arteries. Hardened arteries with inflammation can lead to unstable plaque, which can break into pieces and travel and obstruct blood vessels in the brain. Lack of oxygenated blood flow causes strokes. Understanding plaque features that lead to instability are therefore absolutely critical for doctors to identify patients at risk for stroke. Calcific plaque is fascinating as it may have dual roles in both plaque stability and instability. This project will involve characterizing qualitative and quantitative morphologic features of calcific plaque. Using noninvasive diagnostic neuroimaging exams such as computed tomographic angiography (CTA) to image the blood vessels, we identify patients with diseased vessels with atherosclerotic plaque. Our client team includes neuroradiologists, vascular neurologists, and vascular surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania. Our goal is to develop a browser-based semi-automated tool that identifies morphologic features of carotid atherosclerotic calcifications. Specific morphologic features of interest include, for example, size, number of discrete calcifications, density (e.g., pixel signal intensity), and spatial information relative to the carotid artery vessel wall.

# Special Thanks To

The functionality of this project can be attributed to the talented team who developed Cornerstonejs libraries for processing and displaying DICOM images. It is through their examples on their [website](https://www.cornerstonejs.org/) and their readily available source code on [Github](https://github.com/cornerstonejs) that this project was able to be accomplished at all.
