- import json file and apply changes to segmentations. 

- zoom reset button 

- set up threshold sliders to allow users to set thresholds.

- increase/decrease brush size buttons broken 

- Brush defaults on red (red needs to be used first otherwise everything gets fucked up

- uploading a second pair of dicoms fucks up everything

- Take the project to the next level?  

---- Calculate volume of calcified plaque using labelmap3D (needs some work but works tentatively)
