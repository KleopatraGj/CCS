            <p2>A browser-based semi-automatic tool that identifies morphologic features of carotid
            atherosclerotic calcifications. The current goal of this project is based around allowing
            users to identify areas of calcific plaque build-up and calculating morphologic features 
            of the build up based on the user annotation. Later goals include automatic identification 
            of calcific plaque structures and potentially a machine learning algorithm to improve 
            detection of calcific plaque.</p2>
