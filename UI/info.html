                We are a team of five undergraduate students, who are majoring in Computer Science at the
                University of Massachusetts in Boston. We are hard-working students that chose a very challenging
                but exciting project to work on. This project brought us together to collaborate and
                work as team. Our purpose is to make a successful scanning tool that will meet the needs and
                expectations of our client. We design this tool to help with the penotyping of the calcific 
                atherosclerosis in the carotid artery. However, this tool can also be used for other medical 
                purposes.

                A browser-based semi-automatic tool that identifies morphologic features of carotid
                atherosclerotic calcifications. The current goal of this project and tool is based around allowing
                users to identify areas of calcific plaque build-up and calculating morphologic features
                of the build up based on the user annotation. The user will be able to use the brush tool to paint
                on the medical images and get those annotations by a single click on the display button. The user can use 
                the plus and minus button to change the size of the brush. They also have the opportunity to pick
                between 5 colors (red, green, blue, purple, and pink). There is also a button that clears all the 
                brush annotations on the DICOM image. In case the user does not want to clear all the brush annotations,
                they have the choice to undo single brush strokes. Moreover, if a brush stroke has been deleted by mistake
                there is a redo button that will bring back that brush stroke. Other important tools are the zoom button, 
                which allows for expansion or diminution, the pan button, which allows to move the image around. Last 
                but not least, there is the length button. With the length button, the user can take the length between
                two points on the medical image. The purpose for this button is to find the distance of the calcific plaque
                from the lumen.

                Carotid artherosclerotic plaque in the neck is a common cause of ischemic stroke in the brain.
                Atherosclerosis is the deposition of inflamed fat in the vessel walls that lead to hardening
                of the arteries. Hardened arteries with inflammation can lead to unstable plaque, which can
                break into pieces and travel and obstruct blood vessels in the brain. Lack ofoxygenated blood
                flow causes strokes. Understanding plaque features that lead to instability are, therefore,
                absolutely critical for doctors to identify patients at risk for stroke. Calcific plaque is
                fascinating as it may have dual roles in both plaque stability and instability. This project
                 involves characterizing qualitative and quantitative morphologic features of calcific plaque.
                Using noninvasive diagnostic neuroimaging exams such as computed tomographic angiography (CTA)
                to image the blood vessels, we identify patients with diseased vessels with atherosclerotic plaque.
                Our client team includes neuroradiologists, vascular neurologists, and vascular surgeons at the
                University of Pennsylvania.
