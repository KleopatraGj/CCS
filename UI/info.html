                We are a team of five undergraduate students, who are majoring in Computer Science at the
                University of Massachusetts in Boston. We are hard-working students that chose a very challenging
                but exciting project to work on. This project brought us together to collaborate and
                work as team. Our purpose is to make a successful scanning tool that will meet the needs and
                expectations of our client.

                A browser-based semi-automatic tool that identifies morphologic features of carotid
                atherosclerotic calcifications. The current goal of this project is based around allowing
                users to identify areas of calcific plaque build-up and calculating morphologic features
                of the build up based on the user annotation. Later goals include automatic identification
                of calcific plaque structures and potentially a machine learning algorithm to improve
                detection of calcific plaque.

                Carotid artherosclerotic plaque in the neck is a common cause of ischemic stroke in the brain.
                Atherosclerosis is the deposition of inflamed fat in the vessel walls that lead to hardening
                of the arteries. Hardened arteries with inflammation can lead to unstable plaque, which can
                break into pieces and travel and obstruct blood vessels in the brain. Lack ofoxygenated blood
                flow causes strokes. Understanding plaque features that lead to instability are therefore
                absolutely critical for doctors to identify patients at risk for stroke. Calcific plaque is
                fascinating as it may have dual roles in both plaque stability and instability. This project
                will involve characterizing qualitative and quantitative morphologic features of calcific plaque.
                Using noninvasive diagnostic neuroimaging exams such as computed tomographic angiography (CTA)
                to image the blood vessels, we identify patients with diseased vessels with atherosclerotic plaque.
                Our client team includes neuroradiologists, vascular neurologists, and vascular surgeons at the
                University of Pennsylvania. Our goal is to develop a browser-based semi-automated tool that
                identifies morphologic features of carotid atherosclerotic calcifications. Specific morphologic
                features of interest include, for example, size, number of discrete calcifications, density
                (e.g., pixel signal intensity), and spatial information relative to the carotid artery vessel wall.
